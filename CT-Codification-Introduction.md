# Railway Lines Codification in Poland – Mission Impossible

### Introduction

In Poland we have round 100 freight Railway Undertakings **(RU)** with active licence. In 2023 out of all freight RUs 26 of them executed intermodal transports on national Infrastructure Manager's **(IM)** network. Many intermodal transport units encroach permitted dimentions on IMs network. RUs must run trains with such units on exceptional consigment rules. These rules are inefficient and costly. The alternative to the currently binding rules is introduction of Combined Transport **(CT)** rules in Poland. CT is an intermodal transport governed by EU CT Directive and UIC CT rules. CT term refers to transports, where a major part of the journey is made by rail, inland waterways or sea, and the initial and final legs carried out by road are as short as possible.

## Poland - Current Status

Rules for loading units which encroach loading gauge are set in the national IM's <br>
**Ir-10** ["Instructions on the carriage of exceptional consignments on 1435 mm track"](https://www.plk-sa.pl/files/public/user_upload/pdf/Akty_prawne_i_przepisy/Instrukcje/Wydruk/Ir/Ir-10_instrukcja_o_przewozie_przesylek_nadzwyczajnych_po_torze_1435_mm.pdf "Ir-10 Instruction") **(Ir-10 Instruction)**.

My experience is that RUs and terminal operators as well as shippers need clear statement what is allowed and what is not allowed. More information is needed for these three elements of the rail transport :

1. a wagon,
2. a loading unit,
3. an approved IMs path. <br>

In the Ir-10 Instruction the term **Intermodal** occurs five times :

- twice in the two definions,
- once in the context of Intermodal Loading Units **(ILUs)**,
- once in consignment control protocol exemption,
- once as an additional provision for a template for an exceptional transport approval.

CT terms are less easy to find.

Some terms like: **container** **(Ct)**, **swap body** **(SB)**, **semi-trailer** **(ST)** occure once in the context of ILU definition.
The term **articulated wagon** occurs once in the context of axels distance.
Other terms like **pocketwagon**, **profile**, **codification** or **codified**, and **hybrid** (loading unit) do not appear in the Ir-10 Instruction.

In May 2023 in the IM premises, a meeting of the Rail Council took place. During the meeting the topic and the need for the national railway network codification was reaised again. The topic is important in the context of railway digitalisation and simplificaton of international transfer procedures. One RU suggested that it would make sense to form a working group on the topic of codification. At present it happens that one loading unit can be approved with various dimentions by IM. It happens when one RU adds a lateral loading tolerance to the actual dimensions and the other RU does not, even though they are handing over the same load, on the same wagon type. Months passed and the working group was not formed.

## European Industry Standard

Virtually most of the European Union has the codification of railway gauges implemented. The Polish national IMs rail network is not codified. RUs must apply for an exceptional permission to run intermodal trains, under conditions not specified in commonly available guideline. IM’s railway lines are examined in order to elaborate the conditions of carriage for paths requested by RUs. Each RU receives a permit with condtions for the requested path. These permits have various numbers and defined validity. Two types of permits are available. The **network permit type** serves for the loading units with standard sizes of loading units. The **dedicated permit type** is applied for non-standard loading units. RU requests IM approval for one path. In IM's instruction it is not specified which transportation units have standard and non-standard sizes and construction.

CT codification makes RUs and IMs operations simpler because its rules differ from those applied for exceptional transports **(ET)**. Only non-codified ITUs are to be examined and approved under the current exceptional transport rules.

Recently, some new types of hybrid loading units appeared on the market, with enlarged sizes in relation to the ISO standard sizes. For these hybrid units, IM can create simplified and unified rules for carriage. In addition to the CT Paths Profiles, IM can create and examine conditions for exceptional consignment **(EC)** profiles. Currently, the national IM expressed no interest in simplifying the rules and is closed to open cooperationa with RUS.

## Understanding The Specifics Of Codification In Combined Transport

Codification in CT refers to a system used for the identification and presentation of information about various elements involved in the transport process. The codification system is crucial for efficient operations, documentation handling, involved elements control, and smooth communications in CT.

Carriage in CT involves running of coded **intermodal transport units** **(ITUs)** on special carrier wagons in trains subject to an agreement. These trains have a maximum profile number and run on approved lines subject to a special examination by IMs. If just one of these three elements has no codification, then instead of CT we deal with the exceptional consignment transport regime. Loading units are cofified because they encroach IM's loading gauge.

## Codification Of Railway Lines

IM determines the **combined transport profile** **(CTP)** of a section of line. IM decides how CTPs are calculated whether calculation is based on :

- the structure gauge proximity determined by reference profiles and associated rules,
- the characteristics of exact position of the obstacles on the inspected section of line determined by field measurements (space method).

An allocated line CTP consists of one or more letters followed by one or more numbers of 2 or 3 digits.

## Codification Of ILU

ILU is loading which is suitable for intermodal transport on road, rail and inland waterways or sea. It is a synonym of ITU as defined in the “Glossary for transport statistics.” Cts are the most popular ILUs. SBs, including some hybrid loading units are less common. STs (for vertical transhipment), and roller units (for horizontal transhipment) require specialised wagons and are less commonly transported by rail.

Cts and SB are allocated a C code number describing a loading unit height module depending on their dimensions. Class 1 Cts according to ISO 668 do not require a code number plate. They can be transported in CT on the basis of the dimensions code C as described in UIC Loading Guidelines, Volume 2. Other Cts and SBs require a C code number and if these loading units have a code number plate, only information of this code number plate shall be considered. Roller bodies are allocated a B code number. STs are allocated a P code number.

## Codification Of Freight Wagons

- Wagons intended for ILU tranportation must be marked with wagon compatibility code **(WWC)**,
- allocation of WCC takes place during the authorisation of freight wagon on request of an applicant,
- some wagons due to their geometrical characteristics hold an additional plate or a plate with correction number **(WCD)**,
- additional plates and WCC refer to bi-/multilateral agreements listed in grid,
- wagons dedicated for Ct and SB transport in CT must be marked with a letter C as WCC,
- other types of wagons suitable for these loading units include flat wagons with spigots and flat wagons with wooden floors,
- STs, non-powered road vehicles transported by rail, loaded on fixed-recess wagons (pocket wagons) must be marked with a letter P as WCC.

## Technical Number

The **technical number** **(TN)** is attributed to an ILU. It is a combination of the wagon compatibility code (WCC) and the Combined Transport Profile number (CTP no.) (e.g. **C45**, **P400**)

## CT Train Operational Rules

Each RU must run route compatibility check as specified in TSI OPE Appendix D1.

The compatibility check includes control and comparison of The **CT code** of the loaded freight wagon with the CTP path code. <br>
IF the CT code is lower or eaqual with approved CTP path code then train can run as CT train.
If the CT code is higher than the approved CTP path code then train must run as exceptional transport with IM's permit.

### Summary

The above-mentioned elements of the CT are rough approximations of the complex transport industry concept in Europe. A more detailed insight into the principles of CT is beyond the purpose of this article. The topic may be pursued further in future dissertations.
